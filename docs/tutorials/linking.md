With [`matchMode: "strict"`](../basics/options.md#matchmode), `cross-seed` will
only look for "perfect" matches—candidate file trees that have the exact same file tree,
or a strict subset of the file tree, of the data you already have. Then it injects
the torrents into your client by mirroring the save path of the torrent you already had.

### What is linking?

When a torrent has the same data as another torrent but a different name, you
could theoretically seed both torrents by copying the file and renaming it, but
this isn't practical—you have to store the data twice even though it's
identical. Linking is an alternative to copying that lets two file names point
to the same underlying data on disk. There are three types of links: _symlinks_,
_hardlinks_, and _reflinks_. `cross-seed` uses **hardlinks** by default.

### Should I set up linking?

You don't need to set up linking with the [`matchMode: "strict"`](../basics/options.md#matchmode).
However, you will need to set up linking in order to enable the more complete matching
strategies such as [partial matching](partial-matching.md) or if you want to use
[data-based matching](data-based-matching.md). When linking is enabled, **all**
injected torrents will be linked, even perfect matches.

:::info

In order to prevent collisions, `cross-seed` organizes linked torrents into
subfolders of your [`linkDirs`](../basics/options.md#linkdirs) based on the
tracker each torrent came from. If you wish to disable this behavior, you can
set the [`flatLinking`](../basics/options.md#flatlinking) option to `true`, but
it is not recommended for new users.

## Setting up linking

**`cross-seed` AND YOUR TORRENT CLIENT MUST BE ON THE _SAME_ OS TO USE LINKING**
**(DOCKER ALWAYS RUNS ON LINUX, EVEN ON WINDOWS)**

:::tip

If you cannot use linking, you may want to use
[`duplicateCategories: true`](../basics/options.md#duplicatecategories) if you are using
sonarr or radarr.

:::

:::

To set up linking, you need to define at least one directory where `cross-seed` will create
links to your existing files and set the
[`linkDirs`](../basics/options.md#linkdirs) option to these directories in your
config file. These directories should be accessible to your torrent
client—`cross-seed` will use the `linkDir` on the same device as the save path
for the torrents it injects.

If you are utilizing [`hardlinks`](#hardlink) or [`reflinks`](#reflink) with Docker,
it is necessary that you to use a single mount/volume for each of the `linkDirs` and
the data in your client and/or `dataDirs` from which you're linking . Using
`hardlinks` across two volumes/mounts in Docker will error and fail.

All paths need to be accessible in the same structure as your torrent client for
injection to succeed.

:::tip

Ideally, you should only have a single linkDir and use drive pooling.
Using multiple linkDirs should be reserved for setups with cache/temp drives
or where drive pooling is impossible.

:::

In nearly all cases, your linkDir should reside in your torrent client download
directory. In the example below, your torrent client download directory would be
`/mnt/user/data/torrents/`.

```
mnt/
├─ user/
│  ├─ data/
│  |  ├─ usenet/
│  |  |  ├─ movies/
│  |  ├─ torrents/
│  |  |  ├─ tv/
│  |  ├─ radarr/
│  |  |  ├─ Movie/
│  |  ├─ sonarr/
│  |  |  ├─ Show/
```

Your `linkDir` would then be:

```js
module.exports = {
    // ... other settings ...
    linkDirs: ["/mnt/user/data/torrents/SomeLinkDirName"],
};
```

If you have multiple drives without drive pooling, add more linkDirs as needed
for each drive. Once you have restarted `cross-seed`, new matches will have
links created in your `linkDirs` pointing to the original files.

### Docker Users

**For Docker Users**: there are a few more specific requirements for linking to
work properly.

-   Your torrent client will need access to the `linkDirs` you've set, seeing the
    same path `cross-seed` sees.
-   `cross-seed`'s container needs to be able to see the **original data
    files**, again at the same path that your torrent client sees.
-   If you are using **hardlinks** or **reflinks**, these paths all need to be
    _within the same docker volume_.

In practice, this means that you should mount a **common ancestor path** of the
both the original data files _and_ your `linkDirs`. The example above would
require a single mount of `/mnt/user/data:/data` for **BOTH** cross-seed and your
torrent client. Your `linkDir` would then be:

```js
module.exports = {
    // ... other settings ...
    linkDirs: ["/data/torrents/SomeLinkDirName"],
};
```

## Hardlinks vs Symlinks vs Reflinks

By default, `cross-seed` uses hardlinks to link files because they are resilient
to file moves. You can switch the link type by setting the
[`linkType`](../basics/options.md#linktype) option.

### Hardlink

A hardlink is a **direct line** to the actual data on disk, and as far as the OS
is concerned, is indistinguishable from the original file. Because of this,
hardlinks are resilient to being moved, and if you delete the original file, any
other links to the data will remain intact. The underlying data is deleted once
there are zero files left that point to it.

Because hardlinks are implemented at the filesystem layer, they only work within
the same mountpoint, so you can't hardlink a file from an internal drive to an
external drive. This is especially relevant in Docker setups - Docker volumes
are isolated from each other, so **hardlink sources and destinations must always
be within the same Docker volume**, or else linking will fail.

#### When to use hardlinks

-   Your setup moves files around and you don't want to break links
-   You want to keep cross-seeding torrents even after deleting originals
    -   Look into
        [**qbit_manage**](https://github.com/StuffAnThings/qbit_manage) to still
        be able to delete hardlinked files when originals are deleted

### Reflink

A reflink works similarly to hardlinks until data is written to it. Instead of
modifying both files, only the new data is overwritten on the targeted file.
This means a reflink with a file starts out identical but can diverge over time
if either is modified. This has the same restrictions as [`hardlink`](#hardlink).

#### When to use reflinks

-   Your filesystem supports it
-   You want to cross seed the rare files that differ between trackers. Any
    differences between these two files will not affect the other while still sharing
    the indentical parts.

### Symlink

A symlink is a **shortcut** that stores a path to the original file. OSes have
special support for symlinks that allow programs (like torrent clients) to treat
them as regular files. Because a symlink itself only contains a file path, if
you move or delete the original file, the link will break and trying to open it
will throw an `ENOENT: no such file or directory` error.

#### When to use symlinks

-   Your setup doesn't move files around
-   You have separate drives (e.g. for leeching vs seeding) and therefore cannot
    use hardlinks
-   You want to stop cross-seeding torrents when originals are deleted, but
    don't use [**qbit_manage**](https://github.com/StuffAnThings/qbit_manage)
    -   This will present as cross-seeded torrents with missing files errors in
        your torrent client which you can then bulk delete
-   You prefer errors over accidentally silently copying data
