`cross-seed` gives you the ability to search for cross-seeds as soon as a torrent
finishes downloading, by adding an on-completion script to your torrent client
(or the Sonarr/Radarr
[import script](https://gist.github.com/zakkarry/ddc337a37b038cb84e6248fe8adebb46))
that calls `cross-seed`'s HTTP API.

:::tip

As a bonus, this will also trigger an early run of the
[inject job](./injection.md#manual-or-scheduled-injection) in order
to inject saved cross seeds waiting on this torrent faster.

:::

If you don't set this up, `cross-seed` _will_ eventually search everything
with [`searchCadence`](../basics/options.md#searchcadence).

All the techniques mentioned below boil down to using the `curl` command to send
an HTTP POST request to the `cross-seed` daemon, which will look like this.

```shell
curl -XPOST <BASE_URL>/api/webhook?apikey=<API_KEY>&infoHash=<infoHash>
```

### Step 1: Find Your API Key

:::info Docker

Start by shelling into your docker container:

```shell
docker exec -it cross-seed sh
```

:::

Use the command:

```shell
cross-seed api-key
```

We will refer to this key as `<API_KEY>` in the examples below.

### Step 2: Find your Base URL

#### Non-Docker Users

Your `cross-seed` daemon will be available at:

```shell
http://localhost:2468
```

#### Docker Users

Use:

```shell
http://cross-seed:2468
```

We will refer to this as `<BASE_URL>` below.

### Setting Up Your Torrent Client

There are likely two versions of webhook command you want to use, depending
if you want to include episodes or not. There are other options available to
customize found [`here`](../reference/api.md#request-payload), but these offer
no benefit to download completion.

:::warning

You may be tempted to set `ignoreCrossSeeds: false` for download completion triggers
but this offers no benefits. Partial matches will trigger a completion event in your
client once it completes. This creates a _useless_ webhook search since this media
was just processed by cross-seed.

:::

:::tip

Use the webhook command with `-d "includeSingleEpisodes=true"` while keeping
`includeSingleEpisodes: false` in your config to minimize useless searches.

<summary><strong>rTorrent</strong></summary>

1. Create a script named `rtorrent-cross-seed.sh`, replacing `<BASE_URL>` and
   `<API_KEY>` with the correct values from above:
    ```shell
    #!/bin/sh
    curl -XPOST <BASE_URL>/api/webhook?apikey=<API_KEY> -d "infoHash=$2" -d "includeSingleEpisodes=true"
    ```

    OR

    ```shell
    #!/bin/sh
    curl -XPOST <BASE_URL>/api/webhook?apikey=<API_KEY> -d "infoHash=$2"
    ```
2. Make it executable:
    ```shell
    chmod +x rtorrent-cross-seed.sh
    ```
3. Add to `.rtorrent.rc`:
    ```shell
    echo 'method.insert=d.data_path,simple,"if=(d.is_multi_file),(cat,(d.directory),/),(cat,(d.directory),/,(d.name))"' >> .rtorrent.rc
    echo 'method.set_key=event.download.finished,cross_seed,"execute={'`pwd`/rtorrent-cross-seed.sh',$d.name=,$d.hash=,$d.data_path=}"' >> .rtorrent.rc
    ```
4. Restart rTorrent.
