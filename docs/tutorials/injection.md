title: Direct Client Injection
---

If you use **rTorrent**, **Transmission**, **Deluge**, or **qBittorrent**, `cross-seed`
can inject the torrents it finds directly into your torrent client. This satisfies most
simple use cases. For more complex cases, [**autotorrent2**](https://github.com/JohnDoee/autotorrent2)
or [**qbit_manage**](https://github.com/StuffAnThings/qbit_manage) is recommended.

:::caution Arr Users

There is a potential problem with duplication of imports using either an Arr On Download/Upgrade, Deluge/qBittorrent on complete execution,
or search/rss/announce trigger, which causes race conditions and bad categorizing/labeling when you use inject with `cross-seed`.

Injecting to **qBittorrent/Deluge** and using an **Arr** can result in new cross-seeds being added with the Arr import
category, causing them to get stuck in your Arr's import queue. The workaround is to enable the `duplicateCategories`
option, which will append your category with `.cross-seed` and **if using qBittorrent** either...

-   use the same **pre/post import categories** in your Arr **OR**
-   your Arr's **pre/post import categories** have the same **save path** in qBittorrent.

:::info
`cross-seed` requires access to the directory where your client's .torrent files are stored.

| Client                              | Torrent/Session Folder          |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| [qBittorrent](#qbittorrent-setup)   | `BT_Backup`                     |
| [Deluge](#deluge-setup)             | `state`                         |
| [Transmission](#transmission-setup) | `torrents`                      |
| [rTorrent](#rtorrent-setup)         | session dir from `.rtorrent.rc` |

### `rTorrent` setup

`cross-seed` will inject torrents into **rTorrent** with a `cross-seed` label.

1. Edit your config file:
    1. Set your [`action`](../basics/options#action) option to `inject`.
    2. Set your [`rtorrentRpcUrl`](../basics/options#rtorrentrpcurl) option.
       It should look like an `http` url that looks like
       `http://user:pass@localhost:8080/rutorrent/RPC2` (if you have ruTorrent
       installed). See the [reference](../basics/options#rtorrentrpcurl) for
       more details.
2. Start or restart `cross-seed`. The logs at startup will tell you if
   `cross-seed` was able to connect to rTorrent.

:::tip Docker

In order for `cross-seed` to prove to **rTorrent** that a torrent is completed,
it must check the modification timestamps of all the torrent's files.

Make sure that your `cross-seed` container has **read** access to the **data
directories** of your torrents, mapped to the same path as **rTorrent**.

### `qBittorrent` setup

:::info

Injection will work best if you use the `Original` content layout in qBittorrent options.

:::

1. Edit your config file:
    1. Set your [`action`](../basics/options#action) option to `inject`.
    2. Set your [`qbittorrentUrl`](../basics/options#qbittorrenturl) option.
       It should look like an `http` url that looks like
       `http://user:pass@localhost:8080/` See the
       [reference](../basics/options#qbittorrenturl) for more details.
2. Start or restart `cross-seed`. The logs at startup will tell you if
   `cross-seed` was able to connect to qBittorrent.

### `Transmission` setup

1. Edit your config file:
    1. Set your [`action`](../basics/options#action) option to `inject`.
    2. Set your [`transmissionRpcUrl`](../basics/options#rtorrentrpcurl) option.
       It should look like an `http` url that looks like
       `http://user:pass@localhost:9091/transmission/rpc`
2. Start or restart `cross-seed`. The logs at startup will tell you if
   `cross-seed` was able to connect to Transmission.

### `Deluge` setup

1. Edit your config file:
    1. Set your [`action`](../basics/options#action) option to `inject`.
    2. Set your [`delugeRpcUrl`](../basics/options#delugerpcurl) option.
       It should look like an `http` url that looks like
       `http://:pass@localhost:8112/json` (the colon before `pass` is intentional)
2. Start or restart `cross-seed`. The logs at startup will tell you if
   `cross-seed` was able to connect to Deluge.
