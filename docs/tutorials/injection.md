If you use **rTorrent**, **Transmission**, **Deluge**, or **qBittorrent**, `cross-seed`
can inject the torrents it finds directly into your torrent client. This feature is extremely
robust and can be leveraged manually or through automation external to `cross-seed`.

## Setting up your client

::::tip

[**What should I do after updating my config?**](../basics/faq-troubleshooting.md#what-should-i-do-after-updating-my-config)

:::danger Permissions

`cross-seed` must share the same
[user and group](../basics/getting-started.mdx#with-docker) permissions as the torrent
clients to prevent errors.

:::

:::caution Arr Users

You need to configure [`linking`](./linking.md) or use [`duplicateCategories: true`](../basics/options.md#duplicatecategories) if you are using qBittorrent or Deluge. This will prevent injected cross seeds from being added to your Arr's import queue.

:::

::::

1. Edit your config file:
    1. Set your [`action`](../basics/options#action) option to `inject`.
    2. Set your [`torrentClients`](../basics/options#torrentclients) option.
2. Start or restart `cross-seed` and confirm all clients was successfully connected.

:::tip Docker

In order for `cross-seed` to prove to **rTorrent** that a torrent is completed,
it must check the modification timestamps of all the torrent's files.

Make sure that your `cross-seed` container has **read** access to the **data
directories** of your torrents, mapped to the same path as **rTorrent**.

## Manual or Scheduled Injection

::::warning

`cross-seed` is the **only** program that understands how to properly link and
inject its [partial](./partial-matching.md) and
[seasonFromEpisodes](../basics/options.md#seasonfromepisodes) matches. Other
programs, like [**autotorrent**](https://github.com/JohnDoee/autotorrent), will
not work. You do not need to do anything with torrents saved to
`outputDir`â€”`cross-seed` will handle them unless the torrent is stalled.

:::danger

**DO NOT USE [`outputDir`](../basics/options.md#outputdir) AS A WATCH FOLDER FOR YOUR TORRENT CLIENT!**

:::

::::

In v6, `cross-seed` has the ability to add .torrent files for injection directly. You can either opt to wait for the hourly cadence, or
alternatively run the [`cross-seed inject`](../reference/utils.md#cross-seed-inject) command to attempt injection for .torrent files in
your [`outputDir`](../basics/options.md#outputdir). You can alternatively use `cross-seed inject --inject-dir /path/to/folder` to specify
another directory.

For torrent files being injected manually, if using [`flatLinking: false`](../basics/options.md#flatlinking) will require a
`[mediatype][tracker]` prefix (where tracker is the name corresponding to that tracker's `linkDir` folder) in order to inject within your
existing folder structure.

::::tip
To achieve optimal injection behavior, adding the prefix `[mediatype][tracker-name]` as you would normally see it in
[`outputDir`](../basics/options.md#outputdir) when saving the torrent file is recommended (e.g. `[movie][ProwlarrName]abc.torrent`).

:::info

Current "mediatypes" support are `episode`, `pack`, `movie`, `anime`, `video`, `audio`, `book`, and `unknown`.

:::

Even though the mediatype is required to be valid, it is not currently used during the injection process. This means that if you have lots of torrents files to inject, you can just use `[unknown][tracker-name]` as a prefix for all of them.

::::

This is the same format in which `cross-seed` normally saves .torrent files. If you do not specify both of these parameters,
`cross-seed` will link the torrents into the `UnknownTracker` directory for you, and will require your intervention to sort them
if you wish to do so.

Using this command or utilizing the injection hourly cadence will perform minimal filtering on injection attempts. This means there is the
possibility of slightly increased chance of false-positives with .torrent files you add for injection. All torrent files saved by `cross-seed`
for retrying have already been filtered for matching.

If the .torrent files follow the naming format above, they will be elligible for cleanup if they fall into one of these categories:

- The torrent is in client and complete (successful injection or already exists)
- The torrent has no matches (source torrent/data was likely removed)
- The torrent matches your blocklist

Stalled torrents (either the cross seeded torrent or it's source) will require your intervention before `cross-seed` will remove the .torrent file.
You will need to remove these torrents from your client and the .torrent file from outputDir. If you wish to keep them in client, only remove their .torrent file from outputDir.
