## Overview

There are several changes in `cross-seed` version 6.x. Most of them do not require any action on your part, but some need to be addressed in both the configuration file ([`config.js`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cross-seed/cross-seed/master/src/config.template.cjs)) and potentially permissions or volumes/mounts.

This document outlines the changes made and the actions required to take advantage of all the new features and capabilities.

:::warning HEADS-UP!
`cross-seed` v6 requires Node 20 or greater. Check your Node version with `node --version` and update if needed.

**Docker users can skip this step.**

:::tip
You can grab the new `config.template.js` and simply go through and migrate your missing options over to your current `config.js`. Alternatively, you can add them yourself by referencing our documentation.

### Breaking Changes (TLDR)

| Scope/Area         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| qBittorrent        | If you use `qbit_manage` to enable AutoTMM, you will need to specify `legacyLinking: true` in your config if utilizing any linking functionality.                                                                                                                                                        |
| API authentication | [`apiAuth`](./basics/options.md#apiauth) option was removed and the optional [`apiKey`](./basics/options.md#apikey) option was added. If unspecified, cross-seed will use an autogenerated API key. Use the API key when you make calls to the `/api/webhook` endpoint and the `/api/announce` endpoint. |
| Node               | Minimum required version: v20                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

### Stricter `config.js` Validation

One of the biggest changes made in v6 is better config validation and error messaging. Each option in the config file is validated for formatting and proper syntax. If either is incorrect, a detailed error message will tell you where and how to fix each option.

The new error messages will also provide links to specific documentation for the option and point out bad paths or permission errors if you have any.

This is not going to automatically fix anything for you but will give you a better starting point to try and solve the issue yourself before requiring outside assistance.

### Linking Updates

We have made drastic changes to the way linking operates, both in its implementation and in expanding its capabilities. Not only is linking more versatile in what can be matched now (for instance, previously, files inside a folder would not match to a single-file torrent - this has been fixed), but you can also take advantage of linking when searching .torrent files instead of solely applying to data-based matching.

To achieve torrent linking, you simply have to mount or give permission (if necessary) for `cross-seed` to read and write to the actual torrent data structure (downloaded files) your client uses. This will need to mirror (for docker) the mounts made in the client. Your client will also need to be able to read and write to the [`linkDir`](./basics/options.md#linkdir) folder. You do not need to specify a [`dataDirs`](./basics/options.md#datadirs) with this setup, but simply define a [`linkDir`](./basics/options.md#linkdir).

The new folder structure in v6 for the [`linkDir`](./basics/options.md#linkdir) creates sub-folders for each indexer (for example, `/link_dir/Indexer 1/Name.of.Torrent.File.mkv`). This doesn't change previously matched torrents, but new matches will follow this new structure.

There is, however, a new option introduced into `config.js` named [`legacyLinking`](./basics/options.md#legacylinking) mainly to accommodate users of qBittorrent who want to utilize the Auto Torrent Management (ATMM) feature being automatically enabled by `qbit_manage`. Setting [`legacyLinking`](./basics/options.md#legacylinking) to `true` will tell `cross-seed` to use the same style of linking as v5; one folder with all the linked torrents.

### Updated [`torrentDir`](./basics/options.md#torrentdir) Option

Previously, our recommendation if you wanted to strictly search only [`dataDirs`](./basics/options.md#datadirs) for matches was to point [`torrentDir`](./basics/options.md#torrentdir) at an empty folder. This is no longer necessary. You can now set [`torrentDir`](./basics/options.md#torrentdir) to `null` to achieve a data-only search.

### New [`blockList`](./basics/options.md#blocklist) Option

Another new option added is called [`blockList`](./basics/options.md#blocklist). This option takes an array of strings (`["example", "example2"]`) and will block any matching strings contained in both the release name as well as _exact_ matches.

You can include strings for the full, exact name of a torrent or file (e.g., `"The.Best.Movie.Ever.2024.DV.HDR.Atmos.mkv"`), partial name/keywords (e.g., `best.movie.ever`), or the infoHash from a torrent you wish to block.

### [`apiAuth`](./basics/options.md#apiauth) (removed) and [`apiKey`](./basics/options.md#apikey) (added) Options

`cross-seed` endpoints (announce and webhook) now _require_ API authentication. There are two ways to set up API authentication in v6:

1. Generated Key: By setting [`apiKey`](./basics/options.md#apikey) to `undefined`, `cross-seed` will continue to use a generated key. You can find this key by running `cross-seed api-key`.

    **This is recommended for most users.**

2. Designated Key: You can now set a designated API key for `cross-seed`. Setting `apiKey: "YOURkeyHereMak3It@good1"` in the config file will tell `cross-seed` to always use that key.

The `apiAuth` option in previous versions of `cross-seed` has been removed.

:::warning
While we provide this option, we strongly urge you to use a generated key. If you are specifying a key, please make sure this is a secure and safe key. You are responsible for your security.

### Anime Support (experimental)

Anime is now supported in a **_somewhat limited_** capacity. Please note that this is our first attempt at accommodating this content, so your experience may vary depending on your indexers and content.

We've aimed to cover the inconsistent and unconventional naming conventions that prevail in anime content, but there may be certain naming styles, from specific groups or indexers, that we haven't accounted for.

:::tip HELP
If you come across any anime naming schemes (not just _ONE_ release) that we've missed, please let us know.
:::

### Partial Matching

We've introduced a new mode for [`matchMode`](./basics/options#matchmode) named `partial`.

This mode is similar to `risky` but doesn't necessitate all files to be present. The minimum required "match size" is determined by `1 - fuzzySizeThreshold`. For instance, with a `fuzzySizeThreshold` of `0.05`, potential cross-seeds containing only 95% of the original size will match. This mode is designed to identify cross-seeds missing small files such as nfo, srt, or sample files.

Torrents will be added in a paused state if [`skipRecheck`](./basics/options.md#skiprecheck) is `false` (recommended), and unpaused if `skipRecheck` is `true`. It's advised not to set [`fuzzySizeThreshold`](./basics/options#fuzzysizethreshold) above `0.1` to avoid [triggering excessive snatches](./basics/faq-troubleshooting.md#my-tracker-is-mad-at-me-for-snatching-too-many-torrent-files), **which could lead to the banning or disabling of your account on your trackers.**

### Other Miscellaneous Changes

Here is a short list of other changes made in v6. These are all behind-the-scenes updates made to improve `cross-seed`.

-   Updated to Node v20, ES2022, and TypeScript v5
-   Any indexer failures not related to rate limiting (status code `429`) will be cleared from the database when `cross-seed` is restarted.
-   Regex improvements. Some trackers rename search results or have non-standard naming conventions. The updated regex takes more of those into account and should find more matches.
-   Improved logging messages, specifically around matching decisions.
-   There are now lists of files/folders integrated into `cross-seed` that are blocked during prefiltering at startup. These include folders present in full-disc Bluray/DVD releases, music files, RAR archives, and season folders in Sonarr libraries. Excluding these from the `cross-seed` index (for data-based searches) will result in fewer "bad" searches that would otherwise yield no viable results.
-   New recommended defaults in [`config.template.js`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cross-seed/cross-seed/master/src/config.template.cjs). These settings are what we consider to be the best starting options when setting up `cross-seed`.
