## Introduction

Cross-seeding is the practice of downloading a torrent from one tracker and
using that data to seed across other trackers. This results in minimal downloads
and instant seeding, making it a great way to build ratio and contribute to the
community.

:::info

This software is designed primarily for **private trackers**. If you plan on
cross-seeding on public trackers,
[please see our FAQ](./faq-troubleshooting.md#does-cross-seed-work-on-public-trackers)
for more details.

## Setting Up the Daemon

The most efficient way to use `cross-seed` is to run it in **daemon mode**,
which continuously monitors for new downloads and cross-seeds them
automatically. Here's how to get everything up and running.

### 1. Install `cross-seed`

You can install `cross-seed` using one of the following methods:

#### With `npm` (recommended if you're not using Docker)

You'll need **Node.js 20** or greater.

```shell
npm install -g cross-seed
cross-seed --version
```

#### With Unraid

For Unraid installation, see the [Unraid guide](../tutorials/unraid.md).

#### With Docker

```shell
docker run ghcr.io/cross-seed/cross-seed:6 --version
```

:::info TLDRâ€”just show me the Docker Compose copypasta.

Here you go:

<DockerCompose />

-   Run the container once which will generate the config file.
-   Then skip to [Step 3: Edit the Config File](#3-edit-the-config-file).

Otherwise, continue with the following steps.

:::

### 2. Create a Config File

You'll need to generate a configuration file before running the daemon. Both
Docker and non-Docker users will use the same method for this.

#### For non-Docker users:

Run the following command to generate a config file:

```shell
cross-seed gen-config
```

This will create a basic `config.js` file at `~/.cross-seed/config.js` or
`AppData\Local\cross-seed\config.js`. You can then edit this file to add the
necessary configurations.

#### For Docker users:

Docker users can generate the config file by running the following command:

```shell
docker run \
-v /path/to/config:/config \
ghcr.io/cross-seed/cross-seed gen-config
```

This will create a `config.js` file inside the `/config` directory you
specified. You'll need to open this file and edit it as described below.

---

### 3. Edit the Config File

Once you've created your config file, you'll need to fill in the necessary
fields to connect to your torrent client and indexer. At a minimum, you should
configure the following:

-   **`torznab`**: URLs of your Torznab indexers (from Prowlarr or Jackett).
-   **`outputDir`**: Create a new directory somewhere to house the torrent files
    `cross-seed` outputs.
-   **Connection to your torrent client**: Depending on your client, you'll need
    to specify one of the following:
    -   `rtorrentRpcUrl`: For rTorrent users. Often looks like
        `http://user:pass@localhost:8080/RPC2`
    -   `qbittorrentUrl`: For qBittorrent users. Often looks like
        `http://user:pass@localhost:8080`
    -   `transmissionRpcUrl`: For Transmission users. Often looks like
        `http://user:pass@localhost:9091/transmission/rpc`
    -   `delugeRpcUrl`: For Deluge users. Often looks like
        `http://:pass@localhost:8112/json` (the colon before pass is
        intentional)

Here's an example of what your `config.js` might look like:

```js
module.exports = {
	torznab: ["http://localhost:9696/1/api?apikey=123456"],
	outputDir: "/path/to/output_dir",
	qbittorrentUrl: "http://username:password@localhost:8080",
	... several other settings you can read later ...
};
```

For more details on configuring the connection to your torrent client, refer to
the
[reference guide on torrent client configuration](../tutorials/injection.md).

---

### 4. Run the Daemon

Once you've set up your configuration, you're ready to run the daemon. Start the
daemon with this command:

```shell
cross-seed daemon
```

Or, if you are using Docker, make sure to expose the paths cross-seed needs to
access:

```shell
docker run \
-v /path/to/config:/config \
-v /path/to/torrent_dir:/path/to/torrent_dir \
-v /path/to/output:/path/to/output \
ghcr.io/cross-seed/cross-seed daemon
```

After a few moments, you should see `cross-seed` automatically starting to
search for things in your catalog. It will also automatically scan your
trackers' RSS feeds for new releases you can cross-seed.

:::info

By default, RSS scans will happen every 30 minutes (determined by the
[`rssCadence`](../basics/options#rsscadence) option).

Bulk searches of 400 torrents in your catalog (determined by
[`searchLimit`](../basics/options#searchlimit),
[`excludeRecentSearch`](../basics/options#excluderecentsearch), and
[`excludeOlder`](../basics/options#excludeolder)) will run daily (determined by
[`searchCadence`](../basics/options#searchcadence)).

:::

For now, you can leave the terminal open to keep the daemon running.

#### Troubleshooting

If any configuration issues arise, `cross-seed` will provide feedback in the
terminal, which helps guide you through fixing them. To see more detailed
output, which may help you debug your errors, you can use the `--verbose` flag:

```shell
cross-seed daemon --verbose
```

Regardless of the `--verbose` flag, `cross-seed` will also always log the
verbose output to `<your cross-seed config dir>/logs/verbose.current.log`.

Some common errors are also listed in the
[FAQ and Troubleshooting page](./faq-troubleshooting).

## Next Steps

Once you have the daemon up and running, here are a few additional features you
might want to explore:

-   [**Managing the daemon**](./managing-the-daemon) with Docker or systemd for
    long-term use.
-   [**Notifying cross-seed of completed downloads**](../tutorials/triggering-searches)
    to search for new things more quickly.
-   [**Listening for announces**](https://autobrr.com/3rd-party-tools/cross-seed#cross-seed-filter)
    (external link) to join new swarms as an uploader.
-   [**Setting up partial matches**](../tutorials/partial-matching) to increase
    your seed size even more (at the cost of downloading a few extra NFO files).
-   [**Setting up ID-based searching**](../tutorials/id-searching) for better
    match rates by configuring Sonarr and Radarr
-   [**Explore cross-seed's configuration options**](options) to customize
    `cross-seed`'s behavior to your liking.
