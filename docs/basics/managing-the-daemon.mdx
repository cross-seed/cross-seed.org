import DockerCompose from "./_docker-compose.md";

The easiest way to run the daemon is just to leave a terminal open after running
the following command:

```shell
cross-seed daemon
```

However, that's not very sustainable.

- If you run `cross-seed` on a server that you use `ssh` to log into, then
  `cross-seed` will stop whenever your `ssh` session closes.
- If the server restarts, then you'll have to start `cross-seed` manually.

Below are a few ways you can set up `cross-seed daemon` to run on its own:

- [Docker](#docker)
- [Unraid](#unraid)
- [`systemd`](#systemd-linux)
- [`screen`](#screen)

### Docker

You can use [**Docker Compose**](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install).
Create or open your existing `docker-compose.yml` file and add the `cross-seed`
service:n

<DockerCompose />

After that, you can use the following commands to control it:

```shell
docker-compose pull # Update the container to the latest version of cross-seed
docker-compose up -d # Create/start the container
docker start cross-seed # Start the daemon
docker stop cross-seed # Stop the daemon
docker restart cross-seed # Restart the daemon
docker logs cross-seed # view the logs
```

### Unraid

If you are running `cross-seed` on Unraid you should have installed the
"Community App" from ambipro's repository, this is our official container.

Be default, the
[container runs in daemon mode](../tutorials/unraid.md#automationscheduling) and
no changes are needed.

We recommend you head over to the [Unraid Tutorial](../tutorials/unraid.md) for
specifics and documentation for the container.

### `systemd` (Linux)

If you want to use `systemd` to run `cross-seed daemon` continuously, you can
create a unit file in `/etc/systemd/system`.

```shell
touch /etc/systemd/system/cross-seed.service
```

Open the file in your favorite editor, and paste the following code in. You'll
want to customize the following variables and ensure proper permissions are set
to allow this user/group to read/write/execute appropriately:

- `User`: your user, or another user if you want to create a separate user for
  `cross-seed`
- `Group`: your group, or another group if you want to create a separate group
  for `cross-seed`

:::tip

Get your user and group by running the following command:

```shell
echo -e "User=$(id -un)\nGroup=$(id -gn)"
```

You can also try `ExecStart=npx cross-seed daemon` if the one below doesn't
work.

:::

```unit file (systemd)
[Unit]
Description=cross-seed daemon
[Service]
User=MyUserHere
Group=MyGroupHere
Restart=always
Type=simple
ExecStart=cross-seed daemon
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

:::info

Depending on how you installed cross-seed, you may need to specify absolute
paths to `node` and/or `cross-seed`.

:::

After installing the unit file, you can use these commands to control the
daemon:

```shell
sudo systemctl daemon-reload # tell systemd to reindex to discover the unit file you just created
sudo systemctl enable cross-seed # enable it to run on restart
sudo systemctl start cross-seed # start the service
sudo systemctl stop cross-seed # stop the service
sudo systemctl restart cross-seed # restart the service
sudo journalctl -u cross-seed # view the logs
```

### `screen`

`screen` is a **terminal multiplexer**.

> A Terminal multiplexer is a program that can be used to multiplex login
> sessions inside the Terminal. This allows users to have multiple sessions
> inside a single Terminal window. One of the important features of the Terminal
> multiplexer is that users can attach and detach these sessions.

Running a long-lived `cross-seed daemon` process in `screen` is very easy.

```shell
screen -S cross-seed -d -m cross-seed daemon
```

The above command will start a `screen` instance named `cross-seed` in
`detached` mode, running the `cross-seed daemon` command at launch.

To attach to the `screen`, run the following command:

```shell
screen -r cross-seed
```

Once attached, you can detach with `ctrl-A, D`.

### Windows

::::caution

**`cross-seed` AND YOUR TORRENT CLIENT MUST BE ON THE _SAME_ OS TO USE LINKING**
**(DOCKER ALWAYS RUNS ON LINUX, EVEN ON WINDOWS)**

:::tip

You can still use `cross-seed` without linking, but the features will be
limited.

If you are using Windows 11, you can use the built-in Task Scheduler to run
`cross-seed daemon` after logging in to your user account.

(These instructions should apply to all versions of Windows after Vista).

1. Launch "Task Scheduler" from the Start Menu
2. Right-click on "Task Scheduler Library" and select "Create Basic Task"
3. Enter "Cross Seed" as the name and click "Next"
4. Select "When I log on" as the trigger and click "Next"
5. Select "Start a program" as the action and click "Next"
6. Configure the launch command:

    a. After you've installed cross-seed, you can locate the executable that is
    used to launch it by using the command `where cross-seed` in `cmd` (NOT PowerShell).
    Simply paste the path in the "Program/script" box.

    b. In the "Add arguments" box, enter `daemon`

    c. Click "Next"

7. Check the box to select "Open the Properties dialog for this task when I
   click Finish", then click "Finish"
8. Select the option for "Run whether user is logged on or not", then click "OK"
9. You may want to explore the rest of the advanced options to fine-tune the
   behavior.
10. Finally, test that this works by restarting your PC and checking the
    cross-seed logs for activity
