Here we will install `cross-seed` and run our first search.

## Installation

### with Docker (recommended)

```
docker run crossseed/cross-seed --version
```

### with `npm`

Requires [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 16 or greater.

```shell
npm install -g cross-seed
cross-seed --version
```

### with `yarn`

Requires [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 16 or greater.

```shell
yarn global add cross-seed
cross-seed --version
```

### with Unraid

In Unraid, you can install `cross-seed` from Docker Hub with the Community
Applications app. Check out the [Unraid guide](../tutorials/unraid) for details.

## Running your first search

:::tip

Docker users can skip ahead to [Scaling Up](#with-docker).

:::

To get started, you can use CLI.

For CLI commands, a basic example is below:

```shell
# one liner
cross-seed search --torrent-dir /path/to/dir/with/.torrent/files --output-dir . --torznab https://localhost/prowlarr/1/api?apikey=12345
# readable
cross-seed search \
  --torrent-dir /path/to/dir/with/torrent/files \ # folder containing .torrent files
  -o . \ # any directory, cross-seed will put its output torrents here
  --torznab https://localhost/prowlarr/1/api?apikey=12345 # any valid torznab link, separated by spaces
```

If you were lucky, you've already got your first cross-seed in your current
directory!

:::caution

`cross-seed`, by default, is particular about the contents of torrents you feed
it. It will ignore torrents with non-video files in them, and it will ignore
torrents that look like single episodes.

Use these command line flags to override the default:
`--include-episodes --include-non-videos`

These command line arguments are always configurable in the config.js file (generated with gen-config.)
You won't have to specify them if they are set unless you wish to override the settings temporarily.

Below we will cover the configuration process.

:::

## Scaling Up

Searching like the above is nice, but it's pretty manual and not very useful in
practice. In this section, we'll set up a configuration file. A configuration
file is not necessary to use cross-seed, but it makes things a lot easier.

### without Docker

#### Create and edit your config file

Start by running the following command.

```shell
cross-seed gen-config
```

After that, you will find an autogenerated config file at
`~/.cross-seed/config.js` `AppData\Local\cross-seed\config.js`. Open this file
in your editor of choice, and start editing.

:::tip

The config file uses JavaScript syntax. Each option in the config (and each
element in a list) must be separated by a comma, and make sure to wrap your
strings in "quotation marks" or array (multiple strings) objects in []'s

:::

The only **required** options are [`torznab`](../basics/options.md#torznab),
[`torrentDir`](../basics/options.md#torrentdir), and
[`outputDir`](../basics/options.md#outputdir) (see links for details). Once
you've configured those, you can try running the app with

```shell
cross-seed search
```

With that command, `cross-seed` should get started running through a full scan
of your torrent directory!

### with Docker

#### Set up your container

With Docker, any paths that you would provide as command-line arguments or in
the config file should stay hardcoded. Instead, you can mount volumes to the
Docker container.

- `/config` - config dir (this follows a common Docker convention)
- `/torrents` - your torrent input dir (usually set to your rtorrent session
  dir, or your qBittorrent BT_backup dir)
- `/cross-seeds` - the output dir. People sometimes point this at a watch folder. If you use

Create or open your existing `docker-compose.yml` file and add the `cross-seed`
service:

```yaml
version: "2.1"
services:
  cross-seed:
    image: crossseed/cross-seed
    container_name: cross-seed
    user: 1000:1000 # optional but recommended
    volumes:
      - /path/to/config/folder:/config
      - /path/to/rtorrent_sess:/torrents:ro # note that this volume can and should be mounted read-only
      - /path/to/output/folder:/cross-seeds
      - /path/to/torrent/data:/data # this is optional dataDir path (for data-based matching) - will need to mirror your torrent client's path (like Arr's do)

    command: search
```

#### Create a config file

When you run the container the first time, it will create a config file at
`/config/config.js`. Open this file in your favorite editor. Since you've
already configured your volume mappings, the only required config option is
[`torznab`](../basics/options.md#torznab). Once you've got that setup, you
can run your Docker container and it should get started running through a full
scan of your torrent directory!

## Next Steps

`cross-seed` has two subcommands: `search` and `daemon`.

- `search` (used above) will scan each torrent and dataDir (optional) you provide and look for
  cross-seeds, then exit.

- `daemon` will run indefinitely. It can be configured to run searches periodically, watch RSS,
  and be triggered to search for newly finished downloads.
