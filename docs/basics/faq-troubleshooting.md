# FAQ & Troubleshooting

## Updating to cross-seed v6

If you are updating from version 5.x to version 6.x, you can visit the [v6 migration guide](../v6-migration) for the changes and settings that have been made and introduced. We recommend reading this page before seeking any support, as it should cover most of the immediate questions you may encounter.

### General Suggestions

- Adjust [`excludeRecentSearch` `excludeOlder` and `searchCadence`](./daemon.md#set-up-periodic-searches) to reduce searching indexers needlessly.
- If cross-seed runs continuously with an [`rssCadence`](./options.md#rsscadence), consider reducing the frequency of, or eliminating, searching via [`searchCadence`](./options.md#searchcadence). RSS is capable of catching all releases if ran 24/7.
- The log files in `/logs` - specifically `verbose.*.log` - are your friend. If you experience undesired results from `cross-seed`, look to these files first for indicators of why `cross-seed` performed the way it did.

### Does cross-seed support music torrents?

While `cross-seed` may incidentally find _some_ music matches, it is not optimized for music at all. You may find better results with [crops](https://github.com/soranosita/crops).

### What can I do about `error parsing torrent at http://…`?

This means that the Prowlarr/Jackett download link didn't resolve to a torrent file. It's
possible you've got rate-limited so you might want to try again later.
Otherwise, just ignore it. There's nothing cross-seed will be able to do to fix
it.

### Does cross-seed work on public trackers?

While it is possible, in some cases, for you to cross-seed on public trackers; the majority of public trackers are serving the same torrent file (identical infohash) with different announce URLs. This results in cross-seed seeing what you would assume are matches on different trackers as being torrents you already have in your client. These "matches" will therefore be excluded in cross-seed's decisions. Private torrent sites also set the ['Private Flag'](https://wiki.theory.org/BitTorrentSpecification#Metainfo_File_Structure), meaning that torrent clients cannot add multiple trackers to the same torrent (indentical infohash) with a private flag set. So even if we somehow were able to support matching identical infohashes, it would only work with public trackers.

Another problem is the naming schemes (or lack of one) that the majority of public trackers use. Due to the nature of "anyone can upload", you will get individuals or bots tagging releases with their names, or just otherwise butchering the naming conventions we depend on for properly parsing and matching torrents.

Finally, given that there is no direct, lasting, benefit to you for cross-seeding on public trackers, as there is no account, ratio, reputation, or upload directly associated with you, the benefit YOU will receive if any matches are found is almost non-existent.

All of these factors combine to yield extremely limited results, if any, and the inability, for us, to provide support beyond initial configurations and set up for use on public trackers.

### Why do I get `Unsupported: magnet link detected at…`?

`cross-seed` does not support the usage of magnet links. If your indexer supports torrent files you will need to switch your settings.

### rtorrent injected torrents don't check (or start at all) until force rechecked

Remove any `stop_untied=` schedules from your .rtorrent.rc.

Commonly: `schedule2 = untied_directory, 5, 5, (cat,"stop_untied=",(cfg.watch),"*.torrent")`

### `SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier` when I try and start cross-seed

`cross-seed` configuration files are formatted with commas at the end of each identifier (option), if you are seeing this error it is most likely that you are missing a comma at the end of the setting BEFORE the identifier specified in the error.

Alternatively, you could also be missing quotes around the value you provided. Check the syntax before and around the config setting given in the error.

### Failed to inject, saving instead.

Best way to start troubleshooting this is to check the `logs/verbose.*.log` and find this specific event.

You will be able to see the circumstances around the failure, and start investigating why this occurred.

### My data-based results are paused at 100% after injection

This is by design and due to the way data-based searches function. This is done to prevent automatically downloading
missing files or files that failed to recheck. Until there is a way to guarantee you won't end up downloading
extra (not cross-seeding) this is the best solution.

Alternatively, if you wish for torrents to not inject in a paused state, you can enable `skipRecheck` in the config
file, and this will instead Error on missing/incomplete files.

:::tip
Consider using `infoHash` if you are racing to prevent mismatches.
:::

### My data-based search is searching torrent files!

Torrent files in [`torrentDir`](./options.md#torrentdir) take precedence over data files with the same name and are de-duplicated. If you need to search
specifically the [`dataDirs`](./options.md#datadirs), use an empty directory for [`torrentDir`](./options.md#torrentdir) temporarily. This will strictly search the data.

### Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory

This is usually caused by broken symlinks in, or files being moved or deleted from, your [`dataDirs`](./options.md#datadirs) during a data-based search.
Check the `/logs/verbose.*.log` files for the file causing this.

:::tip
If you do not link files within your `dataDirs` or have them outside of the [`maxDataDepth`](../tutorials/data-based-matching.md#setup) visibility, this is preventable.
:::

### My torrents are injected (qBittorrent) but show `missing files` error!

If you are seeing injected torrents show up with `missing files` error, it is likely because you do not have a save path set for the original torrent's category that cross-seed was cross-seeding from. You should also see a warning when the torrents are being injected telling you that there is no save path set.

Set a save path for the files in that category to fix this.

### I am getting `0 torrents found` with qBittorrent and I set my `torrentDir`

If you are using qBittorrent 4.6.x or later and have the option to use `SQLite database` in the Advanced menu in preferences, you will not be able to do torrent based searches. To be compatible with `cross-seed` you will need to switch this to `fastresume` mode and restart qBittorrent. This will store actual torrent files in your BT_Backup folder. `cross-seed` depends on, and indexes, the torrent files for searching.

We have no current ETA on integration with qBittorrent's SQLite database.

### What [`linkType`](./options.md#linktype) should I use? (data-based searching)

Your options are `"hardlink"` or `"symlink"`. These operate in seperate ways, and depending on your workflow you should choose appropriately. This is a brief description, however
a more in depth guide is available at [Trash's Hardlinking Guide](https://trash-guides.info/Hardlinks/Hardlinks-and-Instant-Moves/).

- symlinks are a "shortcut" of sorts, pointing at the original file from a new location. This can be used across mounts (Docker) or partitions/drives, and does not cost you any extra space. The only possible issue is that if the original file is deleted (when you remove a torrent,) the torrents in your client using the `symlink` will "break" and you will receive errors. If this sounds like a hassle, consider reading further about hardlinks.

- hardlinks are a tricky thing for someone not familiar with the concept but are worth understanding. They are a "direct line" to the actual data on the disk and, as far as the file system is concerned, are indistinguishable from the original. Hardlinks do not require any additional space and the file will remain on the disk until all references to said file are deleted. These linktypes are only possible on the same partition/disk/mount, and you will need to have your [`linkDir`](./options.md#linkdir) set to the same mount (Docker) or partition as your [`dataDirs`](./options.md#datadirs). This is the best approach if you do not always keep the source torrent in your client (due to them being deleted from the tracker) - which would then break symlinks and cross-seeds. This is the approach commonly used in Arr's on import.

:::tip
If you are using qBittorrent, consider checking out [qbit_manage](https://github.com/StuffAnThings/qbit_manage) to manage your hardlinks eligible for deletion.

### I'm getting errors in cross-seed on hostingby.design seedbox

:::tip
Although we are providing the information given from hostingby.design, we are not able to support this directly. This is just what was passed to us. Contact them for details and further instructions if you have any issues
:::

1. Get your shared instance IP address (`cat .install/subnet.lock)
2. Torznab URLs should be: `http://ip:port/prowlarr/[id]/api?apikey=[apikey]`
3. Your torrent client should be on the same subnet (if installed after dec. 2023). If not, update the “bind ip” address in web ui settings to your ip from step 1 and restart the torrent client
4. The torrent client address URL in cross-seed config should be http://user:pass@ip:port (note: no `/qbittorrent` or `/deluge` etc at the end)

:::info
The subnet/shared instances are reverse proxies so no https
:::

### I can't reach my Prowlarr/Jackett/cross-seed/torrent client (Using Docker/VPN)

If you are using [Docker](./getting-started#with-docker), you cannot use `localhost` as an address to communicate across containers. Consider using your host's local IP address (usually a 192 or 10 address) or the container name (if using a "Custom Docker Network").

If your setup is running with a VPN, you will need to either

1. Set up split tunneling
2. Try to use the Docker network addresses as your instance hostnames
3. Address the routing of local/internal traffic in your VPN configuration

Generally, you won't be able to access local instances from services utilizing a VPN since localhost/LAN is not accessible from the VPN network by default.

:::info
There is no need to put cross-seed behind a VPN, all of its requests are directly made to the torrent client or Jackett/Prowlarr.
:::
:::danger
Even with API auth enabled, we still recommend that you **do not expose its port to untrusted networks (such as the Internet).**
:::
:::tip
If you are having issues, your best bet is to contact your VPN software/provider support, they are your best resource.

### Searching media libraries vs. torrent data (data-based searching)

You can search both your media libraries (Arr/Plex) and actual torrent data (downloaded files). If you are using the media libraries with renamed files, you will need to use `matchMode: "risky"` in your configuration file to allow cross-seed some leeway in its matching process. `"risky"` [`matchMode`](./options.md#matchmode) is not recommended to be used without skipRecheck set to false, as it could result in more false positives than `"safe"`.

- Due to the way data-based searching works, risky matching only matches renamed files if they are a single-file torrent. As TV libraries often include renamed files, data-based matching will not be able to pick up matches on multi-file torrents (such as season packs).

### My season packs are cross-seeding individual episodes!

You can use [`includeSingleEpisodes`](./options.md#includesingleepisodes), which expands from [`includeEpisodes`](./options.md#includeepisodes). If you wish to search for season packs as a whole and individual episodes _not_ from a season pack, you will need to set [`includeEpisodes`](./options.md#includeepisodes) to false, and [`includeSingleEpisodes`](./options.md#includesingleepisodes) to true. Both options would be best utilized with [`includeNonVideos`](./options.md#includenonvideos) set to true.

:::tip
Specific configurations for episode and season inclusion can be found in the [config file](https://github.com/cross-seed/cross-seed/blob/master/src/config.template.cjs#L78-L98)
:::

### Why do I see `filetree is different` in my logs?

This is a result of the matching algorithm used by `cross-seed`, and is most commonly associated with a few scenarios. These include the presence of additional .nfo/.srt files in a torrent, differences in the organization of files (one torrent having a folder while the potential match does not, or vice versa), and discrepancies in the filenames within the torrent.

:::tip
You can utilize the [`cross-seed diff`](../reference/utils#cross-seed-diff) command to compare the torrents.
:::

### How can I use [**autobrr**](https://autobrr.com/) with cross-seed?

If you are using [**autobrr**](https://autobrr.com/) to cross-seed, you can use the [`/api/announce`](../reference/api#post-apiannounce) endpoint, rather than [`/api/webhook`](../reference/api#post-apiwebhook), to match against what cross-seed [already knows about your available media](../reference/architecture#prefiltering) (instead of searching your indexers every time).

:::tip
If you want to filter announces even further, consider setting up more specific filters or using [**omegabrr**](https://github.com/autobrr/omegabrr) (which filters based on monitored items in Arrs) to minimize calls to cross-seed.
:::

:::info
For more help setting this up, you can head over to the [autobrr documentation for 3rd-party-tools](https://autobrr.com/3rd-party-tools/#cross-seed-filter) and read more.

### My tracker is mad at me for snatching too many .torrent files!

`cross-seed` searches for and compares potential match's contents and the size(s) of file(s) within those torrents. It is possible you are running searches too often, have configured `cross-seed` in a less-than-desirable way, are not keeping the torrent_cache folder, or are improperly utilizing [**autobrr**](https://autobrr.com/).

:::caution
It is important to note that your tracker may have opinions on the snatching of .torrent files that cross-seed can potentially do, and it is important to respect these or risk your account being disabled.
:::

We try to reduce unnecessary snatches of .torrent files as much as possible, but because we need to compare the files inside the torrent as well as their sizes, it is sometimes unavoidable.

:::warning
`cross-seed` is incredibly configurable and needs a good amount of thought and testing in your configuration before leaving it to do its thing. **We highly recommend you read your tracker's rules, investigate the number of potential searches you will be performing, and thoroughly read the documentation on the options in the config template as well as on this site.**
:::

#### Settings to consider when looking to minimize snatches

---

```js
includeEpisodes: false,
includeSingleEpisodes: true,
```

This will exclude season packs' individual episodes (for data-based searching) while still searching for episodes outside of season packs. Many times individual episodes have been replaced on trackers for the season packs. This is beneficial for initial searches especially.

:::warning
If you do not download or upgrade to season packs, this could still result in excessive searching.
:::

---

```js
includeNonVideos: false,
```

This option will exclude any torrents or folders that contain non-video files. This is useful for excluding things that are not movies or TV content, but will also exclude anything that contains `.nfo`, `.srt`, `.txt` or other non-video files from being searched.

---

```js
matchMode: "safe",
```

:::info
Using [`risky`](./options.md#matchmode) matching will match torrents for snatching based on the size of the torrents and whether the release groups match (if both are present) and compare them regardless of file structures. This will always result in more .torrent files being snatched from the tracker.

Using [`safe`](./options.md#matchmode) matching will match torrents for snatching based on the size and require that the release groups match and compare them, requiring file structure to match.
:::

:::caution
There are TV shows that are not combined into season packs, such as Jeopardy, Talk Shows, or similar. These shows often have naming which specifies dates, rather than SeasonEpisode style. Searching with `includeSingleEpisodes` and using `risky` on these torrents, or files, can result in _many torrent files being downloaded_ for comparisons for matching only _one individual episode_.

Remember, this would occur on just one (torrent) search, within the entire (all data) search.
:::

---

It is highly recommended to use [`excludeOlder` and `excludeRecentSearch`](./daemon.md#set-up-periodic-searches). Both of these are covered [here](./daemon.md#set-up-periodic-searches) as well as on the [options page](./options.md#excludeolder).

Setting something reasonable for both of these based on the amount of content you download is crucial. While we cache your .torrents, it is not beneficial, for example, to repeatedly search the same torrents that are 6 months old every few days. There is no one-size-fits-all setting for this, but you can run cross-seed with your config and see how many torrents it will search and adjust accordingly.

A final set of options to consider are [`searchLimit`](./options.md#searchlimit) and [`searchCadence`](./options.md#searchcadence). These two options combined will limit the number of searches performed on your schedule ([`searchCadence`](./options.md#searchcadence)) and can ease the search queries you are making to your tracker.

---

#### BTN

After discussions with the staff of the site, we have agreed on a recommended set of configuration options that should help to minimize excessive snatching of the .torrent files for comparison. These settings are merely recommendations. You and you alone are responsible for your account and the actions of the software you use with your account.

```js
delay: 30,
excludeRecentSearch: undefined,
excludeOlder: "2w",
searchCadence: "3d",
includeEpisodes: false,
includeSingleEpisodes: false,
includeNonVideos: false,
```

Descriptions for the settings listed above can be found [here](./options.md).
