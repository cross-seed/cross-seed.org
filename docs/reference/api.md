# HTTP API

`cross-seed` has an HTTP API as part of [Daemon Mode](../basics/daemon.md). When
you run the `cross-seed daemon` command, the app starts an HTTP server, listening
on port 2468 (configurable with the [`port`](../basics/options#port) option).

:::tip
You can easily configure your torrent client to [send search commands when a torrent finishes.](../basics/daemon#set-up-automatic-searches-for-finished-downloads)
:::

## Authorization

You can specify an API key using the [`apiKey`](../basics/options.md#apikey) option, or let
`cross-seed` generate one for you (default).

:::info
API authorization using an API key is now mandatory as of v6. The `apiAuth` option has been
deprecated and removed.
:::

:::danger
Even with API authorization, we still recommend that you **do not expose its port to untrusted networks (such as the Internet).**
:::

To find your generated API key, run the `cross-seed api-key` command.
The API key can be included with your requests in either of two ways:

```shell
# provide api key as a query param
curl -XPOST localhost:2468/api/webhook?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY --data-urlencode ...
# provide api key as an HTTP header
curl -XPOST localhost:2468/api/webhook -H "X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" --data-urlencode ...
```

## POST `/api/webhook`

This endpoint invokes a search, on all configured trackers, for a specific
torrent name, infoHash, or torrent data. You can provide the name directly,
or you can provide an infoHash or path to search for, which `cross-seed` will
use to either look up the torrent in your [`torrentDir`](../basics/options#torrentdir) or parse the
filename directly. It will respond with `204 No Content` once it has received your
request successfully.

:::tip
Searches that match a torrent file always take precedence, even in data-based searching.

### Supported formats

| `Content-Type`                      | Supported |
| ----------------------------------- | --------- |
| `application/json`                  | ✅        |
| `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` | ✅        |

### Request Payload

```js
POST /api/webhook
{
	// one of { name, infoHash, path } is required
	name: "<torrent name here>",
	infoHash: "<infoHash of torrent>",
	path: "/path/to/torrent/file.mkv",
	outputDir: "/path/to/output/dir", // optional
}
```

```shell script
curl -XPOST http://localhost:2468/api/webhook \
  --data-urlencode 'name=<torrent name here>' \
  --data-urlencode 'outputDir=/path/to/output/dir'
```

Alternatively, you can use JSON:

```shell script
curl -XPOST http://localhost:2468/api/webhook \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"name":"<torrent name here>"}'
```

## POST `/api/announce`

Use this endpoint to feed announces into cross-seed. For each `announce`,
`cross-seed` will check if the provided search criteria match any torrents you already
have. If found, it will run the matching algorithm to verify that the torrents
do match, and download/inject the announced torrent.

:::tip

This is a real-time alternative to scanning RSS feeds. Consider turning the RSS
scan off ([`rssCadence: null,`](../basics/options.md#rsscadence)) if you set up this feature.

:::

This endpoint returns 200 if your request was received and a completed match was found, 202 if the match was found to be incomplete (still downloading), and if
no match was found will respond with 204 No Content.

### Supported formats

| `Content-Type`                      | Supported |

| `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` | ✅        |

### Request Payload

```js
POST /api/announce
{
	"name": "string", // torrent name
	"guid": "string", // ideally the torrent's comments/listing url, would be for caching purposes
	"link": "string", // download link
	"size": "number", // in bytes
	"tracker": "string" // this is for logging purposes
}
```
